#Custom Collection View Layouts

Herein lie one or more custom UICollectionView layouts, as well as any necessary example applications to explain their usage.

Keep in mind they may be under construction. See the README in the respective layout or example application for more.

##Environment

Unless specified otherwise, the layouts are/use:

- Universal
- ARC
- iOS 6.0+
- Autolayout

##Installation

The example app for a layout (if one exists) will link the layout as a static library.

Alternatively, if I've done my job properly I've created cocoapods for each layout.

##Documentation

Each layout should be documented with appledoc. Please find documentation in the Documentation subdirectory of the layout directory.

##Layouts

- SWCollectionViewLineLayout: ties each cell to a continuous line (for example a timeline)

##License

All layouts and example applications are copyright (c) 2013 Spencer Williams under the MIT License. For more details see the LICENSE file in the respective example app or layout directory.
